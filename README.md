# Umbra: A Quantum-Resistant, Decentralized Cryptocurrency for the Future

*Umbra (UMB)* is designed around the **thesis** that the future of finance lies in **quantum-resistant** blockchain systems that leverage **decentralization**, **security**, and **privacy** as core tenets. It stands at the intersection of cryptography and quantum computing, offering a new paradigm in **cryptocurrency design**.

1. **Quantum Resistance** – Preparing for the quantum computing era with cryptographic solutions that stand the test of time.
2. **Decentralized Governance** – No central authority controls *Umbra*—it’s a community-driven cryptocurrency.
3. **Privacy and Security** – Powered by zero-knowledge proofs and post-quantum encryption, ensuring safe and anonymous transactions.

Instead of relying on traditional blockchain mechanics, *Umbra* leverages **modular cryptographic systems** that dynamically adapt to evolving quantum computing threats. Developers and users can contribute to *Umbra’s* decentralized network without compromising security or transparency.

## Getting Started with Umbra

Welcome to *Umbra*! This guide will help you set up and run your own *Umbra (UMB)* node, interact with the network, and begin integrating it into your own decentralized applications.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.13.0 or higher) – We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to manage Node.js versions:

```bash
nvm install 16.13.0
nvm use 16.13.0
```

- A package manager ([npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/))

### Quick Start

1. Create a new directory for your project and initialize it:

```bash
mkdir my-umbra-node
cd my-umbra-node
```

```bash
pnpm init
```

2. Install the core *Umbra* packages and cryptographic libraries:

```bash
pnpm add @umbra-crypto/core @umbra-crypto/quantum-resistance @umbra-crypto/plugin-proof-of-stake @umbra-crypto/plugin-zk-snarks @umbra-crypto/plugin-december
```

3. Create a new file called `index.ts` in your project root:

```typescript
import { createRuntime } from "@umbra-crypto/core";
import { QuantumProvider } from "@umbra-crypto/quantum-resistance";
import { ProofOfStakeProvider } from "@umbra-crypto/plugin-proof-of-stake";
import { ZkSnarksProvider } from "@umbra-crypto/plugin-zk-snarks";
import { DecemberPlugin } from "@umbra-crypto/plugin-december";
import path from "path";

const runtime = createRuntime({
  quantumProvider: new QuantumProvider({
    algorithm: "lattice-based",
    keySize: 2048
  }),
  consensus: new ProofOfStakeProvider({
    network: "UmbraMainnet"
  }),
  plugins: [new ZkSnarksProvider(), new DecemberPlugin()]
});

// Start the node
console.log("Starting Umbra node...");
runtime.start().catch((error) => {
  console.error("Failed to start node:", error);
  process.exit(1);
});

// Handle shutdown gracefully
process.on("SIGINT", async () => {
  console.log("Shutting down node...");
  await runtime.stop();
  process.exit(0);
});
```

4. Create a `.env` file for your network configurations:

```bash
UMBRA_NODE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

5. Add TypeScript configuration. Create a `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "ES2020",
    "module": "CommonJS",
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "outDir": "./dist"
  },
  "include": ["*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

6. Add build and start scripts to your `package.json`:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "start": "node dist/index.js"
  }
```

7. Build and start your *Umbra* node:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm start
```

8. Test your *Umbra* node by submitting a transaction:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/transaction \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"from": "address1", "to": "address2", "amount": 1000}'
```

You should receive a response confirming the transaction with quantum resistance verification.

## **How It Works**

At its core, *Umbra* dynamically builds execution pipelines that ensure decentralized consensus, security, and quantum resistance:

1. **Quantum Resistance**: Using post-quantum cryptography techniques like lattice-based encryption, *Umbra* ensures that no future quantum computer can break its security model.
2. **Decentralized Consensus**: *Umbra* uses Proof-of-Stake (PoS) to ensure that all nodes validate the network with full participation and fairness.
3. **Security & Privacy**: Zero-knowledge proofs (zk-SNARKs) and secure multi-party computation (SMPC) ensure that transactions are both anonymous and secure.

Rather than rigid workflows, *Umbra* allows for a **modular approach** to expanding its blockchain infrastructure, letting new plugins and cryptographic solutions be added dynamically.

## **Decentralized & Secure Execution**

*Umbra* follows the principles of **decentralized execution** and **quantum-resistant** blockchain technology. Each node is a standalone entity, but they collaborate through a proof-of-stake consensus model, where participants are rewarded for securing the network.

## **Extensibility & Flexibility**

- **Plugin Architecture**: *Umbra* uses a **plugin-first** approach, allowing developers to easily add features like decentralized exchanges, privacy-preserving smart contracts, and more without altering core logic.
- **Modular Components**: *Umbra’s* network is modular—whether you want to integrate new quantum-resistant algorithms or extend the privacy protocols, it’s all achievable.
- **Interoperability**: The blockchain is designed to seamlessly interact with other decentralized networks, ensuring a **truly decentralized financial system**.

## **Why Umbra?**

- **Quantum Resistance**: With lattice-based encryption, *Umbra* provides a future-proof blockchain against the quantum computing threat.
- **Decentralization First**: Full control rests in the hands of the community, with no centralized entity overseeing the network.
- **Privacy and Security**: Through zk-SNARKs and SMPC, *Umbra* ensures that every transaction remains private and secure, even in the face of advanced computational threats.
- **Composability and Extensibility**: Build complex systems with ease by leveraging *Umbra’s* modular architecture.

*Umbra* isn't just another cryptocurrency—it's a **decentralized, quantum-resistant blockchain** for the future of secure and private finance. Whether you're building new decentralized applications or contributing to the *Umbra* network, we are ready to stand in the shadows of tomorrow's crypto world.
